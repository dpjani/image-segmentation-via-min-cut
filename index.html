        <h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>
  
          <p> Graph cut algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms used in computer vision and image processing for tasks such as image segmentation and object detection. </p>
          <p>
          By eliminating a small set of edges, these algorithms seek to divide a graph into two disjointÂ sets (often referred to as source and sink) by maximizing the capacity of the remaining edges or minimizing the overall weight of the deleted edges.
          </p>
          <p>
          This project focuses on using graph cuts to divide an image into background and foreground segments. The framework consists of two parts. First, a network flow graph is built based on the input image. Then a max-flow algorithm is run on the graph in order to find the min-cut, which produces the optimal segmentation.
           </p>
        <h2 id="networkflow"> Network Flow </h2>
          <p> A network flow $G=(V,E)$ is a graph where each edge has a <i> capacity </i> and a <i> flow</i>. Two vertices in the network flow are designated to be the source vertex $s$ and the sink vertex $t$, respectively. The goal is to find the maximum amount of flow that could be delivered from $s$ to $t$, while satisfying the following constraints. </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Capacity constraint: </b> Each edge $(u,v)\in E$ has a nonnegative capacity $c(u,v)$ that must be greater than or equal to its flow $f(u,v)$.
                $$0\leq f(u,v)\leq c(u,v)$$
              </li>
              <li><b>Flow conservation: </b> For all vertices $u\in V-{s,t}$, we require that the inflow of the vertex is equal to its outflow.
                $$\sum_{v\in V}f(v,u)=\sum_{v\in V}f(u,v)$$
              But $s$ can have unlimited inflow, and $t$ can have unlimited outflow.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> The flow of the network is the flow that can be sent through some path from $s$ to $t$, which, by conservation of flow, is equal to the inflow of $s$ or the outflow of $t$.  An $s/t$ cut is a partitioning of the vertices into two disjoint subsets such that one contains $s$ and the other contains $t$. The value of an $s/t$ cut is the total flow of the edges passing through the cut.
          </p>
          <p>
          As stated by the <b> max-flow min-cut theorem</b>, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equivalent to the net flow of the edges in the minimum cut. So by solving the max-flow problem, we directly solve the min-cut problem as well. We will discuss algorithms for finding the max-flow or min-cut in a later section.
          </p> 

        <h2 id="image2graph"> Image to Graph </h2>
          <p>
          One of the most challenging things about this project is how to transform an image into a graph. In <i>Graph cuts and efficient N-D image segmentation</i> by Boykov and Funka-Lea, the authors described in great detail how to define a graph based on an image. My implementation closely follows their idea of constructing the graph. For simplicity, we will use grayscale square images. Although the same idea could be easily extended to colored images with a suitable inter-pixel similarity measurement and also to rectangular images.</p>
          <p>
          In this image-graph transformation scheme, a pixel in the image is a vertex in the graph labeled in row-major order. These vertices are called pixel vertices. In addition, there are two extra vertices that serve as the (invisible) source and the sink.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are two types of edges in our graph. The first type is an $n$-link, which connects neighboring pixel vertices in a 4-neighboring system. The second type of edge is called a $t$-link. $t$-links connect the source or sink vertex with the pixel vertices. 
          </p>
          <p>The $n$-link edges must have weights carefully computed in order to reflect inter-pixel similarities. Concretely, we want the weight of an edge to be large when the two pixels are similar, and small when they are quite different. One idea is to compute the weight from a boundary penalty function that maps two pixel intensities to a positive integer. Let $I_p$ be the brightness, or intensity, of the pixel vertex $p$. For any edge $(p,q)\in E$, the boundary penalty $B(I_p, I_q)$ is defined as:
            $$ B(I_p, I_q) = 100\cdot \exp\Bigg(\frac{-(I_p-I_q)^2}{2\sigma ^2}\Bigg)$$.

          </p> 
          <p>This choice of $\sigma$ is determined from a series of trial and error. The penalty is high if $|I_p-I_q|<\sigma$, and is quite negligible if $|I_p-I_q|>\sigma$. From empirical results, we choose $\sigma=30$. Finally, the result is multiplied by 100 and cast to an integer. This is because network flow models require that the capacities be discrete rather than continuous. 
          </p>
          <p> To facilitate the model to make suitable $t$-links, the user is prompted to highlight at least one pixel vertex as a background pixel and at least one as a foreground pixel. These pixel vertices are called seeds. For every background seed, an edge is added from the source vertex to the background seed with capacity $\mathcal{K}$ defined as follows. 
            $$ \mathcal {K} = \max(\{B(I_p, I_q)|(p, q)\in E\}) $$
          In a similar fashion, edges to the sink vertex are added for every foreground seeds with capacity $\mathcal{K}$.

          </p>
          <p>
          As these seeds share an edge with the source or sink vertices, they are hard-coded to be either the foreground or the background. </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
          Now with the graph fully defined, we can run a graph cut algorithm to find the maximum flow/minimum cut. 
        <h2 id="algos"> Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
        For computing minimum-cut/maximum-flow, we can use algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson, Dinic's Algorithm and more. In this project, I will be utilizing GrabCut method, Felzenswalb's Algorithm and Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm for graph-based image segmentation. The time-complexity for each of them has high-variance. </p>
        <p><b>GrabCut </b></p>
        <p>
        The GrabCut algorithm is commonly used for image segmentation tasks, and does not directly use minimum cut or maximum flow algorithms. Instead, it employs an iterative optimization technique based on graph cuts.
          </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/grabcut.png", alt="GrabCut">
          <figcaption> An example of GrabCut method for image segmentation ((Huang et al., 2017)). </figcaption>
          </figure>

        <p> The algorithm used in GrabCut is an iterative optimization process that alternates between estimating the foreground and background regions of the image and updating the probability distributions based on these estimates. This process is guided by a graph-based energy function that incorporates both color similarity and spatial coherence constraints.  </p>
        
<pre><code>  # Simple implementation of GrabCut<br>
  <b>function</b> grabCut(image, mask):
    Initialize foreground <b>and</b> background models
    Repeat <b>until</b> convergence:
        Assign pixels <b>to</b> foreground <b>or</b> background based <b>on</b> mask
        Update models
        Minimize energy
    <b>Return</b> segmented image
</code></pre>
        
    <p>
      Initializing the foreground and background models typically has a time complexity of $O(N)$, where N is the number of pixels in the image. Updating the Gaussian models for foreground and background involves iterating over all pixels in the image, resulting in a time complexity of $O(N)$. Minimizing the energy typically involves solving an optimization problem, such as graph cuts, which can have a time complexity that depends on the specific optimization technique used. Let's denote the time complexity of energy minimization as $O(E)$.  the overall time complexity of the GrabCut algorithm can be approximated as:
<code><b>$O(N + K * (N + E))$</b></code>
    </p>

        <p><b>Felzenswalb's Algorithm </b></p>
        <p>
        Felzenszwalb algorithm is an image segmentation algorithm developed by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher. This algorithm is widely used for segmenting images into meaningful regions based on the differences in intensity or color.</p>
        <p>
        The Felzenszwalb algorithm is based on a graph-based approach where pixels are represented as nodes in a graph, and edges are defined based on the similarity between neighboring pixels. The algorithm then iteratively merges regions based on a criterion that combines both color similarity and spatial proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
        One of the advantages of the Felzenszwalb algorithm is its ability to produce hierarchical segmentations, where segments can be merged or split at different scales. This allows for a more flexible representation of image regions compared to traditional segmentation methods.
      </p>
<pre><code><b>function</b> felzenszwalbSegmentation(image, scale, sigma, min_size):
    constructGraph(image)
    sortEdgesByWeight()
    mergeSegments()
    postProcessSegments(min_size)
    return segmentedImage</code></pre>
        
        <p>
        Felzenszwalb algorithm approximately runs in $O(N log N)$ time, where N is the number of pixels in the image. This approach is better than GrabCut and improves our time complexity. </p>

        <p><b>Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm </b></p>
        <p>
        The Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm (the BK algorithm or BK max-flow/min-cut algorithm)  is a powerful and efficient method for solving the minimum cut problem and, by extension, the maximum flow problem in graphs. It was introduced by Vladimir Kolmogorov and Yuri Boykov.</p>
        <p>
        This algorithm has high efficiency and accuracy in solving large-scale graph cut problems, making it widely used in computer vision, image segmentation, and other areas where graph-based optimization is required.
        </p>
        <p>
The Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm is based on the max-flow min-cut theorem, which states that the maximum flow passing through a network is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut in the network. The algorithm efficiently finds the minimum cut by iteratively finding augmenting paths and updating the flow in the network.
      </p>

        <p>
            The Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm's time complexity is commonly expressed as $O(V * E * log(V))$, where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph. This time complexity arises from the use of binary heap data structures in the algorithm for finding augmenting paths, which typically have a time complexity of $(O(log(V))$ for insertion and deletion operations.
          </p>
          
        
        <h2 id="limits"> Limitations </h2>
          <p>
          While the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is effective for finding maximum flows in networks, it can be inefficient for large networks with dense connectivity. In such cases, the algorithm may take a long time to converge to the optimal solution or may even encounter issues such as infinite loops. The algorithm may require significant memory, especially when dealing with large networks or graphs.  </p>

          <p> GrabCut requires an initial rectangle or mask to initialize the segmentation. The quality of this initialization can significantly affect the segmentation result.  For large images, GrabCut may require substantial memory and processing power, especially when dealing with high-resolution images.</p>

          <p> The performance of Felzenszwalb's algorithm can be sensitive to the parameters such as scale, sigma, and minimum size. Tuning these parameters may be required to achieve desired segmentation results across different types of images. The algorithm's time complexity can increase with the number of pixels and the complexity of the image structure. For very large images, the computational requirements may become prohibitive. </p>
        
          <p> While the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm often provides good results, it does not guarantee an optimal solution in all cases. The quality of the segmentation may depend on the specific characteristics of the image and the chosen parameters. The computational complexity of the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm can be high, especially for large graphs or images with complex structures. This can limit its applicability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. </p>
